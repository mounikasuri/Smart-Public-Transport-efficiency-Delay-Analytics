**Project Summary**
This Power BI project focuses on the analysis of APSRTC bus transportation data to generate actionable business insights for operational efficiency and strategic improvements. The project involved importing and cleansing the APSRTC_Cleaned.csv dataset, which contains detailed records of routes, depots, dates, passenger counts, occupancy rates, revenue, fuel usage, and related operational attributes. Data transformation steps included ensuring consistent data types, handling missing values, and removing unnecessary columns to prepare the dataset for reliable analysis. Although only one table was supplied, standard modeling practices—such as checking data integrity, organizing field hierarchies, and setting up logical groupings—were followed to optimize dashboard design.

The visualization phase produced a comprehensive dashboard using a variety of Power BI visuals. Key insights were unlocked through line charts (showing total revenue and fuel consumption trends by month), bar charts (displaying occupancy rates by bus type and passenger count by route), and clustered bar charts (comparing revenue and occupancy across depots). Slicers for month, day of week, and bus type were implemented to enable user interactivity, facilitating focused and dynamic analysis for the end user.​

**Project Conclusion**
The interactive Power BI dashboard built for APSRTC delivers deep, actionable insights into bus operations and business performance, showcasing the strengths of modern BI tools in public sector analytics. Stakeholders can now quickly identify high-performing routes, optimize resource allocation by analyzing occupancy rates and fuel consumption trends, and investigate depot-specific revenue performance. Interactive slicers allow for instant filtering by time periods, days, and bus types, providing a 360-degree, on-demand view of the organization’s transit activity. This approach not only enhances reporting and monitoring, but also supports continuous improvement through data-driven decision-making—demonstrating how Power BI can transform raw transport data into an essential strategic resource.
